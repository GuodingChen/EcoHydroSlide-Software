# EcoHydroSlide-Software
The eco-hydro-geotechnical model is written by languages of Fortran and Matlab. The framework is executed by several steps that we will introduce here. Users are advised to read this manual along with the paper we have published. First of all, we'd like to declare the computational hardware that is necessary for modeling.

#### Hardware

- Operating system: Linux
- Random access memory (RAM): > 8G
- Available Storage: > 50G

We have tested the model on [Delft High Performance Computing Centre](https://www.tudelft.nl/dhpc) (**DHPC**). The operating system version is Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 8.6 (Ootpa). The model is also expected to be executed on other Linux release versions. MATLAB environment (with [Parallel Computing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html)) is also required for the modeling workflow.
