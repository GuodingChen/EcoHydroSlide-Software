# EcoHydroSlide-Software
The eco-hydro-geotechnical model is written by languages of Fortran and Matlab. The framework is executed by several steps that we will introduce here. Users are advised to read this manual along with the paper we have published. First of all, we'd like to declare the computational hardware that is necessary for modeling.
